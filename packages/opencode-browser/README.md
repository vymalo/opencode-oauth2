This is the **OpenCode plugin** half of a dual plugin. It registers `browser_*` tools the model
can call and hosts a localhost WebSocket **bridge**. A companion **browser extension**
(Chromium MV3 + Firefox) connects to the bridge and drives real tabs.

> Browser extensions can't host servers, so the plugin is the server and the extension dials
> out to it. The plugin runs on Bun (inside OpenCode) and serves the bridge with `Bun.serve`.

## How it works

1. OpenCode loads the plugin; it binds a WebSocket bridge on `127.0.0.1:<port>` and prints a
   shared `token` (or uses the one you set).
2. You load the extension once, paste the bridge URL + token into its dashboard, and connect.
3. The model calls a `browser_*` tool → the plugin sends a command frame over the bridge → the
   extension executes it against a real tab → the result comes back to the model.

The extension and plugin agree on a small, dependency-free wire protocol; the same protocol is
mirrored into the extension so the two never drift.

## Install

```jsonc
// opencode.json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [["@vymalo/opencode-browser", { "port": 4517 }]]
}
```

On first run with no `token`, the plugin generates one and logs it once
(`browser_bridge_token_generated`). Paste that into the extension's dashboard along with the
bridge URL (`ws://127.0.0.1:4517`).

Get the extension from the [Releases page](https://github.com/vymalo/opencode-oauth2/releases)
(`opencode-browser-extension-<version>-chrome.zip` / `-firefox.zip`), from the Chrome Web Store /
Firefox Add-ons, or build it from
[`apps/browser-extension`](https://github.com/vymalo/opencode-oauth2/tree/main/apps/browser-extension).

## Quickstart

A typical first session, end to end:

```text
You:    Open example.com in a group called "research" and tell me the page heading.
Model:  browser_open({ group: "research", url: "https://example.com" })
        browser_snapshot({ group: "research" })          → refs e1, e2, …
        browser_get_text({ group: "research" })
        → "Example Domain — This domain is for use in illustrative examples…"

You:    Screenshot it.
Model:  browser_screenshot({ group: "research", fullPage: true })
        → "Saved screenshot to .opencode/browser/research/2026-…png (1280×3200)."
        (the model then reads that file to see it)
```

A titled **tab group** named "research" appears in the browser; the extension dashboard logs
every action and keeps a screenshot gallery.

## Options

Second argument to the plugin tuple in `opencode.json`:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch. |
| `host` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Bind interface. **Keep it loopback** — see [Security](#security). |
| `port` | `4517` | Bridge port. |
| `token` | _generated_ | Shared secret the extension must present. Empty string ⇒ generated + logged. |
| `groups` | `["page","control"]` | Tool groups to register (`page` \| `control` \| `debug`). |
| `executor` | `"auto"` | `auto` \| `cdp` \| `content` — forwarded to the extension as a preference. |
| `timeoutMs` | `30000` | Per-command timeout. |
| `screenshotDir` | `".opencode/browser"` | Screenshot output dir (relative → resolved against the worktree). |

## The 33 tools

Names are stable `browser_*` identifiers, partitioned into three **groups** gated by the
`groups` option. Every tool takes a `group` (the named tab group) unless noted.

### `page` — observe (8, default on)

| Tool | Key args | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_snapshot` | `group` | Accessibility/DOM outline with stable **refs** the other tools target. Start here. |
| `browser_get_text` | `group, tabId?` | Visible/readable text of the active tab. |
| `browser_get_html` | `group, ref?/selector?, outer?` | HTML of an element or the document. |
| `browser_get_attribute` | `group, ref?/selector, name?` | Tag, text, value, and attributes of an element. |
| `browser_query` | `group, selector, limit?` | Match a CSS selector → list of elements with fresh refs. |
| `browser_tabs` | `group?` | List groups and their tabs. Omit `group` for everything you own. |
| `browser_targets` | — | List connected browsers (for multi-browser routing). |
| `browser_screenshot` | `group, fullPage?, tabId?` | PNG to disk; returns the path. See [Screenshots](#screenshots). |

### `control` — drive (19, default on)

| Tool | Key args | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_open` | `group, url?, focus?, target?` | Open a tab in the group (creates the group on first use). |
| `browser_navigate` | `group, url, tabId?` | Navigate an existing tab. |
| `browser_back` / `browser_forward` / `browser_reload` | `group, tabId?` | History / reload. |
| `browser_activate` | `group, tabId?` | Bring a tab to the foreground. |
| `browser_click` | `group, ref?/selector?/x?,y?, button?` | Click an element or coordinates. |
| `browser_double_click` | `group, ref?/selector?/x?,y?` | Double-click. |
| `browser_hover` | `group, ref?/selector?/x?,y?` | Hover. |
| `browser_drag` | `group, fromRef?/fromSelector?, ref?/selector?` | Drag source → target. |
| `browser_type` | `group, text, ref?/selector?, submit?` | Type into a field (optionally press Enter). |
| `browser_fill` | `group, fields:[{ref?/selector,value}]` | Batch-fill several fields. |
| `browser_select` | `group, ref?/selector, value?/values?` | Choose `<select>` option(s). |
| `browser_press_key` | `group, key` | Press a key or chord (`"Enter"`, `"Control+a"`). |
| `browser_scroll` | `group, deltaX?, deltaY?, ref?, to?` | Scroll the page or an element. |
| `browser_upload` | `group, ref?/selector, paths:[…]` | Attach file(s) to a file input (CDP/Chromium). |
| `browser_wait` | `group, ms?/selector?, state?` | Wait a fixed delay or for a selector. |
| `browser_close` | `group, tabId?` | Close a tab, or the whole group if `tabId` omitted. |
| `browser_release` | `group?` | Hand the browser back (detach CDP) without closing tabs. |

### `debug` — powerful / sensitive (6, **off by default**)

Enable with `{ "groups": ["page","control","debug"] }`.

| Tool | Key args | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_eval` | `group, code, tabId?` | Evaluate arbitrary JavaScript in the page. |
| `browser_console` | `group` | Recent console messages. |
| `browser_network` | `group` | Recent network requests. |
| `browser_handle_dialog` | `group, accept?, promptText?` | Accept/dismiss a native `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt`. |
| `browser_set_viewport` | `group, width, height, mobile?, deviceScaleFactor?` | Emulate a viewport (CDP/Chromium only). |
| `browser_cookies` | `op, url?, name?, …` | Get/list/set/clear cookies (profile-wide). |

## Targeting elements — prefer refs

Two ways to address an element:

- **By ref (recommended)** — call `browser_snapshot` (or `browser_query`), get back stable refs
  like `e1`, `e2`, then `browser_click({ group, ref: "e3" })`. Refs survive minor layout shifts
  and are far more reliable than brittle selectors.
- **By CSS selector or coordinates** — `selector: "#login"` or `x`/`y`. Useful for canvases,
  maps, and elements a snapshot doesn't expose.

## Screenshots

OpenCode tool output is **text-only** — it can't carry an image. So the plugin writes the PNG to
`<screenshotDir>/<group>/<timestamp>.png` and returns the path; the model then opens it with
OpenCode's built-in `read` tool (which renders images). `fullPage: true` captures the whole
scrollable page (CDP `captureBeyondViewport` on Chromium; scroll-and-stitch on the content
executor). The extension also keeps a copy in its dashboard gallery.

> screenshots as **inline images** (MCP can carry them).

## Named groups

Every action targets a **group** — a named bucket of tabs the agent created. On Chromium groups
map to real `chrome.tabGroups` (titled, colored); on Firefox they're a logical registry. Groups
keep each task's tabs isolated and inspectable, and are the unit of ownership when multiple
agents share one bridge.

## Scoping tools per agent

There are **two independent levers**, and they answer different questions:

| Lever | Scope | Use it to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `groups` plugin option | **Global** — which tools are *registered* at all | Set the org-wide default surface. |
| OpenCode agent `tools` map | **Per-agent** — which registered tools an agent may *call* | Give each agent only the tools it needs. |

If your team keeps **all groups enabled by default** (`"groups": ["page","control","debug"]`),
the `groups` option won't narrow anything — every `browser_*` tool is registered. To restrict an
individual agent, use OpenCode's per-agent **`tools`** map (a `{ "<tool>": true|false }` record on
the agent). The tool names are stable `browser_*` identifiers (see [the 33 tools](#the-33-tools)),
so you target them directly. This is OpenCode's own mechanism — nothing plugin-specific.

### Denylist — drop the sensitive tools (most common)

Keep everything except the `debug` group and destructive actions for a general agent:

```jsonc
// opencode.json
{
  "plugin": [["@vymalo/opencode-browser", {}]],   // all groups stay registered
  "agent": {
    "build": {
      "tools": {
        "browser_eval": false,
        "browser_cookies": false,
        "browser_console": false,
        "browser_network": false,
        "browser_handle_dialog": false,
        "browser_set_viewport": false,
        "browser_close": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Allowlist — a read-only research agent (observe, never drive)

Disable the whole namespace with a wildcard, then re-enable only the `page` tools you want. A
more specific key wins over the `browser_*` wildcard:

```jsonc
{
  "agent": {
    "researcher": {
      "description": "Reads pages, never changes them.",
      "tools": {
        "browser_*": false,
        "browser_open": true,
        "browser_navigate": true,
        "browser_snapshot": true,
        "browser_get_text": true,
        "browser_query": true,
        "browser_screenshot": true,
        "browser_tabs": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Markdown agents

The same `tools` map works in a `.opencode/agent/<name>.md` front-matter file:

```markdown
---
description: Reads pages, never changes them.
tools:
  browser_*: false
  browser_snapshot: true
  browser_get_text: true
  browser_screenshot: true
---
You are a read-only web researcher. Use browser_snapshot to get refs, then read.
```

> The plugin-level `groups` option is still useful as a hard floor — e.g. **never** register
> `debug` org-wide with `{ "groups": ["page","control"] }`, then no agent can re-enable
> `browser_eval` no matter its `tools` map. Use `groups` for "nobody gets this," and the agent
> `tools` map for "this agent only gets these."

## Multiple browsers & agents

The bridge is an **auto-elect broker**: multiple agents (plugin, MCP, sessions) and multiple
executors (browsers) can share one bridge. The first process to bind the port becomes the host;
others join as guests. Groups are owned by the agent that created them (owner-exclusive), and
ownership is rebuilt automatically on failover. Use `browser_targets` to see connected browsers
and `browser_open({ target })` to pick one. Full design:
[`plans/multi-client-routing.md`](https://github.com/vymalo/opencode-oauth2/blob/main/plans/multi-client-routing.md).

## Executors: CDP vs content-script

- **CDP executor** (`chrome.debugger`, Chromium) — trusted input, full-page capture, console &
  network logs. Shows Chrome's "being debugged" banner — an intentional signal.
- **Content-script executor** — synthetic events + `captureVisibleTab`; the Firefox-safe
  fallback, also used when the debugger is unavailable.

`executor: "auto"` picks CDP on Chromium when the `debugger` permission is granted, else the
content script. Force one with `"cdp"` / `"content"`.

## Stopping / releasing control

Control is **plugin-managed** — you never disconnect by hand. It's released when:

- the model/plugin calls **`browser_release`** (mid-session), or
- **OpenCode exits** — the plugin's `exit` hook shuts the bridge down, and the dropped socket
  independently makes the extension release. A hard kill releases too.

## Security

The bridge binds `127.0.0.1` only and requires a token handshake. It grants the model control of
a **real browser profile** — **use a dedicated or throwaway Chrome profile**, not your daily one.
The `chrome.debugger` banner is a deliberate, continuous indicator that automation is active.
`debug` tools (`browser_eval`, `browser_cookies`, …) are off by default for this reason. See the
consolidated [`docs/security.md`](https://github.com/vymalo/opencode-oauth2/blob/main/docs/security.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| --- | --- |
| Extension won't connect | URL/token mismatch, or another process already on the port. Re-copy the logged token. |
| "being debugged" banner stays after a session | Normal until release; `browser_release` or exiting OpenCode clears it. |
| `set_viewport` / full-page differs on Firefox | CDP-only features; Firefox uses the content executor. |
| Screenshot path returned but model "can't see" it | The model must `read` the path — output is text-only. |
