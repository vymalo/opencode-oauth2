# Architecture Decision Records

Short, dated records of decisions that shaped this workspace and the reasoning behind
them — so a future reader (or a future us) can see *why* a thing is the way it is without
reverse-engineering it from the code or the git log.

We only write an ADR when a decision is **load-bearing and non-obvious**: it closes off
alternatives someone would reasonably reach for, or it encodes a constraint that isn't
visible from the code alone. Routine choices don't need one.

## Format

Each record is `NNNN-kebab-title.md`, numbered in order, and follows a light
[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)-style shape:

- **Status** — `Accepted` / `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` / `Deprecated`. Records are
  append-only: we don't rewrite a decision, we supersede it with a new one and link both ways.
- **Context** — the forces in play when the decision was made.
- **Decision** — what we chose, stated plainly.
- **Consequences** — what this buys us and what it costs us.
- **Alternatives considered** — what we rejected and *why* (this is the part future-you
  will actually come back for).
