# Browser automation (`@vymalo/opencode-browser` + extension)

Give an OpenCode agent **hands in a real browser** — open tabs, click, type, scroll,
screenshot — scoped into **named groups** so each task's tabs stay isolated and inspectable.

This is a **dual plugin**:

| Half | Package | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenCode plugin | `@vymalo/opencode-browser` (`packages/opencode-browser`) | Registers `browser_*` **tools** the model calls, and hosts a localhost **WebSocket bridge**. |
| Browser extension | `apps/browser-extension` (private, Chromium MV3 + Firefox) | A React/Tailwind/shadcn app whose background worker dials the bridge and drives real tabs. |

## Topology — an auto-elect broker

Browser extensions **cannot host servers**, but a background service worker *can* open an
outbound WebSocket to `127.0.0.1`. So an **agent** (the plugin or the MCP server) hosts the
bridge and the extension connects out to it. The bridge is served with the Node `ws` package,
which runs under **both** runtimes OpenCode uses — Bun (the CLI / `opencode web`) and Node (the
desktop app) — so the plugin hosts the bridge in either.

The bridge is a **broker** with two roles: **agents** (producers — the plugin, the MCP server,
extra sessions) and **executors** (the browser extensions). The first agent to start wins the
port bind and runs the broker in-process; later agents detect the bound port and connect as
**guests**. If the host exits, a guest re-binds and takes over. This means you can run the
plugin and the MCP server (or several sessions) at once — see [Multiple browsers & agents](#multiple-browsers--agents).

```

```

The model calls e.g. `browser_open(group: "research", url: …)`. The tool's `execute` sends a
`command` frame over the bridge; the extension performs it and returns a `result`; the tool
shapes that into output for the model.

## Setup

### 1. Enable the plugin

Add it to your OpenCode config (or serve it from a `.well-known/opencode` document). The
second tuple element is the plugin's options:

```jsonc
{
  "plugin": [
    ["@vymalo/opencode-browser", { "port": 4517 }]
  ]
}
```

Options (all optional):

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch. When `false` the bridge never starts. |
| `host` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Interface to bind. Keep it loopback. |
| `port` | `4517` | WebSocket bridge port. |
| `token` | _generated_ | Shared secret the extension must present. If omitted, a random token is generated and **logged once** (`browser_bridge_token_generated`) — copy it into the extension. |
| `executor` | `"auto"` | Forwarded executor preference: `auto` \| `cdp` \| `content`. |
| `groups` | `["page","control"]` | Which tool groups to register (`page` \| `control` \| `debug` \| `interactive`). `debug` and `interactive` are opt-in. |
| `timeoutMs` | `30000` | Default per-command timeout before the tool call rejects. A tool may request a longer per-command deadline (e.g. `browser_request_feedback`), capped at 10 min. |
| `screenshotDir` | `".opencode/browser"` | Where screenshots are written (relative paths resolve against the session worktree). |

On first run with no `token`, watch the log for:

```
browser_bridge_token_generated  paste_into_extension=<token>
```

### 2. Load the extension

Grab a prebuilt zip from the repo's **GitHub Release** (`opencode-browser-extension-<version>-chrome.zip`
/ `-firefox.zip`) and unzip it, or build it yourself:

```sh
cd apps/browser-extension
pnpm build              # → .output/chrome-mv3
pnpm zip                # → .output/opencode-browser-extension-<version>-chrome.zip
```

- **Chrome/Edge/Brave**: `chrome://extensions` → enable Developer mode → *Load unpacked* →
  pick `.output/chrome-mv3`.
- **Firefox**: `pnpm build:firefox` → `about:debugging` → *Load Temporary Add-on* →
  pick `.output/firefox-mv2/manifest.json`.

Open the extension's **dashboard** (toolbar icon → *Dashboard*), paste the bridge URL
(`ws://127.0.0.1:4517`) and the token, pick an executor, and *Save & reconnect*. The popup
and dashboard show **Connected** once the handshake succeeds.

## Tools

`group` is the primary handle on every tool — it names the tab group the action targets, and
the extension creates it on the first `browser_open`.

The 34 tools are organized into four **groups**, gated by the `groups` option (plugin) /
`OCB_GROUPS` (MCP). Default: `page` + `control` (`debug` and `interactive` are opt-in). The
`browser_*` names are stable, so OpenCode's per-agent tool allow/deny works on them directly too.

**`page`** — observe (read-mostly):

| Tool | Key args | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_snapshot` | `group` | Accessibility/DOM snapshot with stable **refs**. |
| `browser_get_text` | `group, tabId?` | Visible text of the page. |
| `browser_get_html` | `group, ref?/selector?, outer?` | HTML of the page or an element. |
| `browser_get_attribute` | `group, ref?/selector?, name?` | Tag, text, value, checked, box, attributes. |
| `browser_query` | `group, selector, limit?` | Matching elements, each with a ref. |
| `browser_screenshot` | `group, fullPage?, tabId?` | PNG (disk path in OpenCode; inline image in MCP). |
| `browser_tabs` | `group?` | Lists groups + tabs. |
| `browser_targets` | — | Lists connected browsers (for multi-browser routing). |

**`control`** — drive:

| Tool | Key args | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_open` | `group, url?, focus?, target?` | Opens a tab in the group (optionally on a chosen browser). |
| `browser_navigate` | `group, url, tabId?` | Navigates the active (or given) tab. |
| `browser_back` / `browser_forward` / `browser_reload` | `group, tabId?` | History nav / reload. |
| `browser_click` | `group, ref?\|selector?\|x,y, button?` | Clicks (left/middle/right). |
| `browser_double_click` | `group, ref?\|selector?\|x,y` | Double-clicks. |
| `browser_hover` | `group, ref?\|selector?\|x,y` | Hovers (reveals menus/tooltips). |
| `browser_drag` | `group, fromRef?/fromSelector?, ref?/selector?` | Drag-and-drop. |
| `browser_type` | `group, text, ref?/selector?, submit?` | Types into a field; optional Enter. |
| `browser_fill` | `group, fields: [{ ref?/selector, value }]` | Batch form fill. |
| `browser_select` | `group, ref?/selector, value\|values` | Sets `<select>` option(s). |
| `browser_scroll` | `group, deltaX?, deltaY?, ref?, to?` | Scrolls page or element (`ref` to scroll within one). |
| `browser_press_key` | `group, key` | Presses a key / chord. |
| `browser_upload` | `group, ref?/selector, paths[]` | Sets a file `<input>` (CDP only). |
| `browser_wait` | `group, ms?\|selector?, state?` | Fixed delay or wait-for-selector. |
| `browser_activate` | `group, tabId?` | Brings a tab to the foreground. |
| `browser_close` | `group, tabId?` | Closes a tab, or the whole group. |
| `browser_release` | — | Releases control (detaches the debugger) without closing tabs. |

**`debug`** — powerful / sensitive (**off by default**; mostly CDP/Chromium-only):

| Tool | Key args | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_eval` | `group, code, tabId?` | Evaluates JS in the page DOM, returns the result. |
| `browser_console` | `group` | Recent console output (CDP only). |
| `browser_network` | `group` | Recent network requests (CDP only). |
| `browser_handle_dialog` | `group, accept?, promptText?` | Accept/dismiss a JS dialog (CDP only). |
| `browser_set_viewport` | `group, width, height, mobile?, deviceScaleFactor?` | Emulate a viewport (CDP only). |
| `browser_cookies` | `op, url?, name?, value?` | Read/modify cookies. |

**`interactive`** — ask the human on the page and block on them (**off by default**):

| Tool | Key args | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_request_feedback` | `group, mode, prompt?, options?, timeoutMs?` | Paints a branded overlay and blocks until the user responds. |

This is the one tool that **waits on a human** rather than acting autonomously — use it when a
screenshot or snapshot isn't enough to know what the user means ("which of these did you mean?").
`mode`:

- `confirm` — a yes/no bar; returns `{ kind: "confirm", value }`.
- `choose` — buttons for each `options[]` entry; returns `{ kind: "choice", value }`.
- `point` — the user clicks one spot; resolves to the **element ref** under the click (plus a CSS
  selector and pixel coords).
- `element` — hover highlights the element under the cursor; a click picks it →
  `{ kind: "element", ref, selector, text }`.
- `region` — the user drags a box; returns `{ kind: "region", rect, refs }` where `refs` are the
  snapshot refs of every element inside the box.
- `comment` — click a spot, then type a free-text note; the point annotation carries `text`.

point/element/region resolve to element **refs** so you can immediately `browser_click ref:…` or
`browser_snapshot` them — refs, not pixels, are what the agent acts on.

The overlay is clearly branded as opencode-browser (so a page can't spoof the prompt), dismissible
(Esc / Skip), and raises the toolbar badge + focuses the tab to get the user's attention. On no
response it returns `{ responded: false, timedOut: true }`. The wait uses a long per-command
timeout (default 120 s, max ~290 s, capped broker-side at 10 min); if the agent's turn is aborted
or times out, the broker sends a `cancel` frame that tears the overlay down — a blocking prompt
never orphans state in the page. Meaningless in headless/CI routing (no human at the browser),
where it simply times out.

**Side-panel fallback (overlay-blocked pages).** On pages where the overlay can't be injected
(`chrome://`, the Web Store, CSP-locked origins), the extension captures a screenshot and routes the
request to its **side panel** (Chromium `chrome.sidePanel` / Firefox sidebar) instead. Since neither
browser lets an extension force the panel open, the badge turns to `?` and — while a request is
pending — clicking the toolbar icon opens the panel (normal popup behavior is restored once it
resolves). The panel shows the screenshot with the same modes; because there's no live DOM on these
pages, `point`/`region` return **screenshot-pixel** coordinates (no element refs) and `confirm` /
`choose` work fully. Only if a screenshot can't be taken either does the tool return
`{ responded: false, error }` so the agent falls back to its own reasoning.

> Not yet implemented: a marker-annotated **screenshot** return (deferred — the structured refs are
> more actionable than pixels, and a single tool result can't carry both).

### Scoping tools and token cost

Two composable levers: **`groups` / `OCB_GROUPS`** (global — what's *registered*; the ceiling) and
**per-agent `permission`** (which registered tools each agent gets). Approximate cost of the full
surface (name + description + args schema, ≈chars/4):

| Registered groups | Tools | ≈ tokens (agent granted all) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | 8 | ~1,000 |
| `page` + `control` (default) | 27 | ~3,700 |
| all three | 33 | ~4,560 |

**Per-agent scoping CAN cut context tokens — but only in the flat string `permission` form.** The
nested form and the deprecated `tools` boolean map gate *execution* but still inject the schema:

| Form | Example | Trims context? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| flat string `permission` | `"browser_eval": "deny"` | ✅ dropped from the agent's tools |
| nested `permission` | `"browser_eval": { "*": "deny" }` | ❌ execution gate only |
| `tools` map (deprecated) | `"browser_eval": false` (≡ nested `{"*":"deny"}`) | ❌ execution gate only |

Verified on OpenCode **1.17.6**; confirm on your version via an agent's actual context token count.
(The "registering a group floods every agent" observation comes from the nested/`tools`-boolean
form.) Recommended pattern — register the full surface once, scope per agent with flat strings:

```jsonc
{
  "plugin": [["@vymalo/opencode-browser", { "groups": ["page", "control", "debug"] }]],   // global
  "agent": {
    "researcher": {
      "permission": {
        "browser_*": "deny",                                   // start from nothing…
        "browser_open": "allow", "browser_navigate": "allow",  // …allow only what's needed
        "browser_snapshot": "allow", "browser_get_text": "allow",
        "browser_query": "allow", "browser_screenshot": "allow"
      }
    },
    "automator": { "permission": { "browser_*": "allow" } }
  }
}
```

(Schemas sit in the cached prefix, so prompt caching softens the per-request dollar cost; trimming
still helps the window + cache writes.) See OpenCode's [agent docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/).

### Targeting elements — prefer refs

`browser_snapshot` walks the page, tags interactive elements with a `data-ocb-ref` attribute
(`e1, e2, …`), and returns lines like:

```
e3	button	"Search"
e4	a	"Home" → https://example.com/
e7	input [email]	"you@example.com"
```

Pass those refs to `browser_click({ ref: "e3" })` etc. Refs are stable within a single
snapshot and far more reliable than guessing CSS selectors. You can still use `selector` or
absolute `x`/`y` coordinates.

### Screenshots — disk + the `read` tool

OpenCode tool results are **text only** — there's no image channel. So `browser_screenshot`
writes the PNG to `<worktree>/.opencode/browser/<group>/<timestamp>.png` and returns the path.
The model then **`read`s that path** to view the image (OpenCode's `read` tool emits an image
part). The extension also keeps a copy in IndexedDB for the dashboard gallery.

## Named groups

On **Chromium** a group maps to a real titled **tab group** (`chrome.tabs.group` +
`chrome.tabGroups.update`). On **Firefox** there is no tab-groups API, so the extension keeps a
**logical** registry only (tabs still work; they just aren't visually grouped). This degrades
gracefully and is the only meaningful Firefox difference besides the executor.

## Executors — CDP vs content-script

The trusted-input surface (click/type/key) and screenshots have two backends; everything else
(snapshot, text, scroll, fill, select, wait) is DOM-only and runs identically via
`chrome.scripting.executeScript`.

| | `cdp` (Chromium) | `content` (fallback / Firefox) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input | **Trusted** CDP events (`Input.dispatch*`) — `isTrusted: true` | Synthetic DOM events (`isTrusted: false`) |
| Screenshot | `Page.captureScreenshot`, full-page via `captureBeyondViewport` | `tabs.captureVisibleTab` + **scroll-and-stitch** for full-page (OffscreenCanvas) |
| Banner | Shows Chrome's "being debugged" banner (intentional signal) | None |
| Browser | Chromium only | Chromium + Firefox |

Synthetic key events on the content-script executor don't trigger the browser's native editing
actions, so the extension applies the common ones (Backspace/Delete/Enter in inputs) itself —
trusted shortcuts and rarer keys are only reliable on the CDP executor.

Full-page screenshots on the content executor are produced by **scroll-and-stitch**: the page
is scrolled one viewport at a time, each slice captured with `tabs.captureVisibleTab`, and the
slices composited onto an `OffscreenCanvas`. Two caveats vs CDP's native full-page capture:
`position: fixed` elements repeat in each slice, and very tall pages are captured up to a
safety cap (≈20 viewports / 16k device px) and reported as `partial` in the tool output.

`executor: "auto"` picks CDP when `chrome.debugger` is available, else content-script. The
**"being debugged" banner is a feature** — a visible indicator that automation is active. If
the user dismisses it, the extension transparently re-attaches on the next action.

**Precedence.** The executor is normally chosen in the extension's dashboard. If the operator
sets the plugin's `executor` option, the plugin advertises it in the handshake and the
extension adopts it **on each connect** (overriding the dashboard choice) — useful for
`.well-known/opencode` server-shipped config. Leave the plugin option unset to let the
dashboard be authoritative.

## Stopping / releasing control

Handing the browser back is the **plugin's** job — you shouldn't have to click
Disconnect. Three things release control (detach the CDP debugger; tabs stay open and a later
command transparently re-attaches):

- **`browser_release`** — the model/plugin calls it when done. The bridge sends a `release`
  frame and the extension detaches.
- **OpenCode exits** — the plugin's `exit` hook calls `bridge.shutdown()` (a `release` frame +
  server stop), and the dropped socket independently triggers the extension to release. So a
  hard kill releases too.
- **Manual** — the dashboard's Disconnect still works, and so does the `chrome.debugger` banner's
  Cancel button.

## Wire protocol

Dependency-free JSON frames (canonical definition: `packages/opencode-browser/src/protocol.ts`;
the extension mirrors it at `apps/browser-extension/src/shared/protocol.ts`).

| Frame | Direction | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hello` | ext → server | Handshake; carries the token. |
| `ready` | server → ext | Handshake accepted. |
| `command` | server → ext | Perform an action (correlated by `id`). |
| `result` | ext → server | Reply (`ok` + `data` or `error`). |
| `event` | ext → server | Unsolicited (`tab_closed`, `navigated`, …). |
| `ping`/`pong` | both | Heartbeat. |

The bridge keeps a single authenticated client (latest valid `hello` wins), a pending-request
map with per-command timeout + `AbortSignal` wiring, and rejects all in-flight commands if the
extension disconnects.

## Security model

- The bridge binds **`127.0.0.1` only** and requires a **shared-token** handshake.
- It grants the model control of a **real browser profile** — use a **dedicated or throwaway
  Chrome profile**, not your daily one with logged-in sessions.
- The `chrome.debugger` banner is an intentional, visible "automation is on" signal.
- The token is logged once (auto-generated case) so you can paste it into the extension;
  provided tokens are never logged (the logger redacts `token`-like fields).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
| --- | --- |
| Tool error: *no browser extension is connected* | Extension isn't connected. Open the dashboard, check the URL/token, *Save & reconnect*. |
| Dashboard stuck *connecting* | Wrong port or the plugin didn't start the bridge. Check the OpenCode log for `browser_bridge_listening`. |
| *no token set* in the dashboard | Paste the `paste_into_extension` token from the plugin log, read it from [`bridge.json`](#the-bridge-state-file-bridgejson), or set `token` in plugin options and use that. |
| `debugger attach failed` | Another debugger (DevTools) is attached, or you forced `cdp` on Firefox. Switch executor to `content`. |
| Screenshot path returned but model can't see it | Use the `read` tool on the returned path — tool output can't carry images. |
| Clicks ignored on a strict site | You're on the content-script executor (synthetic events). Switch to `cdp` on Chromium for trusted input. |

## Multiple browsers & agents

The broker routes by **group ownership**, so several browsers and several agents can share one
bridge:

- **Multiple browsers (executors).** Connect more than one extension (e.g. Chrome + Firefox, or
  two profiles). Give each a **label** in its dashboard (defaults to a generated id). `browser_targets`
  lists them as `{ id, label, browser, groups }`. Choose where a new group opens with `target` on
  `browser_open` (`browser_open(group:"research", target:"work-chrome")`); later commands for that
  group follow it automatically. Omit `target` with a single browser.
- **Multiple agents (producers).** Run the plugin and the MCP server (or several sessions) at the
  same time — whichever starts first hosts the broker; the rest are guests. A group is **owned by
  the agent that created it**: another agent gets `group "X" is owned by another client`, so give
  your agents distinct group names. When an agent exits, its groups become **orphaned** and the
  next agent to use one adopts it (tabs survive).
- **Token sharing.** The plugin and the MCP server auto-share the port + token through a per-user
  [`bridge.json`](#the-bridge-state-file-bridgejson) state file, so a generated token **persists
  across sessions** — you paste it into the extension once, not every launch. Set an explicit
  `token` / `OCB_TOKEN` to be deterministic (and to win a simultaneous cold start). On a
  non-explicit launch the token is also re-logged as `browser_bridge_token` if you need it again.
- **Failover.** If the hosting agent quits, a guest re-binds and rebuilds group→browser ownership
  by re-querying each extension's tabs. During the brief re-election window commands fail fast with
  `bridge is re-electing` and the model retries.

Full design notes: [`plans/multi-client-routing.md`](../plans/multi-client-routing.md).

### The bridge state file (`bridge.json`)

The plugin and the MCP server persist the bridge **port + token** to a small per-user JSON file
so you paste the token into the extension **once**, not every launch (and so a second adapter on
the same machine picks up the same secret). It lives in the persistent per-OS app-data directory —
**not** the temp dir, so it survives reboots:

| OS | Path |
| --- | --- |
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/opencode-browser/bridge.json` |
| **Linux** | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/opencode-browser/bridge.json` — default `~/.local/state/opencode-browser/bridge.json` |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\opencode-browser\bridge.json` — default `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\opencode-browser\bridge.json` |

The contents are just the active port and shared secret:

```json
{ "port": 4517, "token": "a1b2c3d4…" }
```

The file is written owner-only (`0600`, in a `0700` directory). To read the current token without
hunting through the OpenCode log:

```sh
# macOS
cat "$HOME/Library/Application Support/opencode-browser/bridge.json"
# Linux
cat "${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/opencode-browser/bridge.json"
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-Content "$env:APPDATA\opencode-browser\bridge.json"
```

Notes:

- **Reset the token.** Delete `bridge.json` (or set an explicit `token` / `OCB_TOKEN`). The next
  launch generates a fresh token, rewrites the file, and logs it once as `browser_bridge_token` —
  re-paste it into the extension dashboard.
- **Explicit token wins.** An explicit `token` (plugin option) / `OCB_TOKEN` (MCP) overrides
  whatever is in the file; it's still written back so other adapters on the host converge on it.
- **Legacy location (≤ 0.7.x).** Older builds kept this in the temp dir
  (`$TMPDIR/opencode-browser-bridge.json` / `%TEMP%\opencode-browser-bridge.json`), which the OS
  clears on reboot — that's why the token used to change every restart. It's still read **once** as
  a fallback so upgrading doesn't force a re-paste, then migrated to the path above on the next write.

## Use it from other agents (MCP)

The browser tools aren't tied to OpenCode. **`@vymalo/opencode-browser-mcp`** is an MCP stdio
server that hosts the same bridge and exposes the same group-filtered `browser_*` tools over the
Model Context Protocol — so Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Zed, etc. can drive the extension.
Screenshots come back as **inline image content** (no disk-path step).

```jsonc
// e.g. an MCP client config
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@vymalo/opencode-browser-mcp"],
      "env": { "OCB_TOKEN": "your-shared-token", "OCB_GROUPS": "page,control" }
    }
  }
}
```

Env: `OCB_TOKEN` (shared secret; generated + printed to stderr if unset), `OCB_PORT` (4517),
`OCB_HOST` (127.0.0.1), `OCB_GROUPS` (csv, default `page,control`). All logging goes to stderr
(stdout is the JSON-RPC stream). Paste the URL + token into the extension dashboard exactly as
with the plugin — the extension doesn't care which adapter is on the other end of the bridge.

The OpenCode plugin and the MCP server share one **tool catalog** (`catalog.ts`), so the two
surfaces never drift.

## Development

```sh
# Plugin
pnpm --filter @vymalo/opencode-browser build      # tsc → dist/
pnpm --filter @vymalo/opencode-browser test       # vitest

# Extension
cd apps/browser-extension
pnpm dev            # WXT dev server + HMR (Chrome)
pnpm dev:firefox    # WXT dev server (Firefox)
pnpm build          # production .output/chrome-mv3
pnpm zip            # packaged zip
pnpm typecheck      # wxt prepare && tsc --noEmit
```

## Publishing the extension to the web stores

A release ships **three** artifacts: the two npm packages (`@vymalo/opencode-browser`,
`@vymalo/opencode-browser-mcp`) and the extension. The extension isn't on npm — it goes to
the **Chrome Web Store** and **Firefox Add-ons (AMO)**, with the same zips also attached to the
GitHub Release as a manual-install fallback.

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` automates this. On a published GitHub Release it runs the full
gate (typecheck/test/lint/build), zips the extension, then a separate `submit-extension` job
(`needs: publish`) runs `wxt submit` to push to each store. **Each store is gated on its own
credentials** — set up Chrome alone, Firefox alone, or both; a store with no secrets is skipped,
not failed.

### One-time store setup

Both stores require a first **manual** upload to create the listing (name, icons, screenshots,
description, privacy disclosures) — the API can only push *updates* to an existing item.

1. **Build the zips** locally: `pnpm --filter @vymalo/opencode-browser-extension zip && pnpm --filter @vymalo/opencode-browser-extension zip:firefox`.
2. **Chrome Web Store** — create the item in the [Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole) (one-time $5 fee), upload `…-chrome.zip`, fill the listing, submit for review. Note the **Extension ID**.
3. **Firefox AMO** — create the add-on at [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/), upload `…-firefox.zip` (and the `…-sources.zip` when prompted — AMO requires reviewable sources for bundled code). Note the **add-on ID** (the `gecko.id`/UUID).

### Credentials → GitHub repository secrets

Generate API credentials once and store them as repo secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables
→ Actions). Locally you can `cp .env.submit.example apps/browser-extension/.env.submit` and fill
it to test with `pnpm --filter @vymalo/opencode-browser-extension submit:chrome -- --dry-run`.

| Store | Secret | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID` | The item's ID from the dashboard. |
| Chrome | `CHROME_CLIENT_ID` / `CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET` / `CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN` | A Google Cloud OAuth client with the **Chrome Web Store API** enabled. See the [WXT submit guide](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/publishing.html#chrome-web-store). |
| Firefox | `FIREFOX_EXTENSION_ID` | The add-on UUID / `gecko.id`. |
| Firefox | `FIREFOX_JWT_ISSUER` / `FIREFOX_JWT_SECRET` | AMO API credentials from your [AMO API keys](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/addon/api/key/). |

### Triggering & validating

- **Publish a GitHub Release** → npm publish runs, then `submit-extension` pushes to whichever
  stores are configured.
- **Dry run**: Actions → *Publish* → *Run workflow* with `dry_run: true` → `wxt submit --dry-run`
  validates credentials and the zip for each configured store **without uploading**. Use this to
  confirm secrets are wired before a real release.
- Chrome and Firefox both re-review every update; the API submit only *queues* the new version —
  it goes live after their review passes.
